<h1>The best Movies According to Kamran</h1>
<h2>My top-3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
<p>The movie's hero was Robert Downy Junior, such a great movie.
It gave me a sense of intellect of 19th Century's detectives</p>
<h3>SpiderMan : No way Home</h3>
<p>Really Cool Science-Fictional Movie.It contained the concept of the existance of "Multi-verses" and brought up the SpiderMen
    of other multiverses as well</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Equiupped with an unending love of "Jack" and "Rose",and a horror of death as well.</p>
